Open phpmyadmin through local host
make a database called what ever you want
insert sql code and then update data-base.php, replace logindb, with what ever you you named the database when you added the sql code
the table in the sql is called users, dont change that or the code will break, if you wish to change it, you will need to change the code

IMPORTANT
If you serve the php project even with the local host running, the website will not work, you have to type "localhost/filename/signup.php" for it to work, trying it through another domain with data-base.php in its current configuration will not work
If you host this website, the data-base.php username, password, dbname and id or whatever will need to be changed. 

If your gonna use this for a school project, please don't use my css, make ya own.
